# 16-Updated-Portfolio-2

This project is an exercise in building a third iteration of a personal portfolio page from scratch and deploying webpage code using primarily Bootstrap.

The project requires the planning of a webpage and contains outside links to other Github projects, a personal Github repository, and LinkedIn. The page displayes the developer's name, avatar, links to the associated projects, Github repos, and the deployed application. Examples of projects have titles and images for application, particularly the first project which is prominently displayed.

The layout is responsive and adapts to different viewports.

A link to the deployed application can be located at: https://danqest.github.io/16-Updated-Portfolio-2/
